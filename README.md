# pricingTable-Front-end-Project

This project show cases a neat little front end page about business solutions. It demonstrates effective HTML organization and simple CSS construction in addition to integrated google fonts and an outside CSS code snippet. I made this during my time in Colt Steele's Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp.
